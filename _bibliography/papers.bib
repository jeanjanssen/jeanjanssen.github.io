  title={CODA With Symbolic Regression},
  author={Spelthan, R.},
  abstract={APG uses CODA to validate whether every mutation of a client's pension is calculated correctly. Currently, this is being done by linear regression, but this requires domain knowledge and pre-processing, and doesn't explain all mutations. In this report a Genetic Algorithm with Symbolic Regression is introduced, with the aim to explain certain groups as well as, or better than the linear regression method CODA currently uses. To explain the mutations, additional methods such as LASSO and Variable Switch were introduced. The Genetic Algorithm is shown to be an effective method to combine input variables and explain mutations. Future research should be done towards to further increase the explanation rate and decrease run time.},

  title={Image Classification on Histopathological Colon
and Lung Cancer data},
  author={Spelthan, R.},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a study on image classification of histopathological colon and lung cancer images. Using a dataset of these images, we trained 4 state-of-the-art image classification models, 2 simple CNN architectures, 2 Transformer models and 4 Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network models. We evaluated the performance using various metrics, including cross entropy loss, accuracy, precision and F1 score. We further try to give insight to why certain models choose classify the image with or without cancer, we did this using saliency maps, integrated gradients and integrated gradients with smoothgrad squared. Our results show that ResNet18 is the best performing image classification model, that there is a potential to using Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks, and that models that correctly classify images have a more specific focus in images than models that incorrectly classify images.},

@article{spelthan2023Quantum,
  abbr={ArXiv},
  title={Quantum One-Class Classification},
  author={Spelthan, R.},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose and evaluate three different quantum one-class classification (QOCC) algorithms for anomaly detection and outlier detection. The first algorithm is an One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) with enhanced feature spaces using a ZZFeatureMap, the second algorithm is a Variational quantum one-class classifier, and the third algorithm is a normal Variational quantum circuit.
We evaluate the performance of the algorithms using the evaluation metric Macro F1-score, since this gives us the best balance between correctly identifying outliers and inliers. We also compare the results with the classical one-class classification methods to highlight the advantages of the proposed quantum one-class classification methods. Our results show that the proposed QOCC algorithms achieve a slight improvement in performance over the classical methods in specific datasets, but generally seems to perform as well or worse than classical methods. We also discuss the current challenges and open problems and identify potential directions for future research.},
