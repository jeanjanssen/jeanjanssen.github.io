  title={CODA With Symbolic Regression},
  author={Spelthan, R.},
  abstract={APG uses CODA to validate whether every mutation of a client's pension is calculated correctly. Currently, this is being done by linear regression, but this requires domain knowledge and pre-processing, and doesn't explain all mutations. In this report a Genetic Algorithm with Symbolic Regression is introduced, with the aim to explain certain groups as well as, or better than the linear regression method CODA currently uses. To explain the mutations, additional methods such as LASSO and Variable Switch were introduced. The Genetic Algorithm is shown to be an effective method to combine input variables and explain mutations. Future research should be done towards to further increase the explanation rate and decrease run time.},
