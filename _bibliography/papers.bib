  title={Analysing glucose regulation in silico: Modeling insulin secretion via PID control},
  author={Janssen, J.},
  abstract={Blood glucose levels in the human body are maintained through a network of various hormones and peptides that regulate complex mechanisms including the secretion of insulin and the disposal of glucose to muscle tissue. In this thesis, we explore PID control to model insulin secretion in a physiology-based computational model in the Julia Programming Language. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of estimating digital twins (personalized computational models) of an individual's glucose insulin-regulation using the least squares parameter estimation technique in the Julia Programming language.},

  title={Exploring Audio Data with Recurrence Plots: Beta-Divergence, Visualisation Techniques, and Computational Methods},
  author={Janssen, J. and Kotala, S. and Khan, M. and Tanim, A.},
  abstract={Visualizations are often more comprehensible and user-friendly than raw data, making them a preferred method of interpretation for many individuals. Repetition of a specific event is a very common scenario in practical systems. By applying RPs, we can easily generate an intuitive visualization that helps to identify the recurrences or repetition of dynamical systems. These recurrences show up as lines or artifacts (single block not forming a line) in visualization as seen in Figure 1. In the context of stuttering analysis, we aim to employ visual tools to identify instances of recurrence in speech and to distinguish between stuttered and fluent speech based on visual characteristics.},

  title={Detection and Severity Classification on Knee Osteoarthritis X-ray Images},
  author={Janssen, J.},
  abstract={This paper addresses the challenges in diagnosing and classifying knee osteoarthritis (KOA) severity using traditional methods. Using machine learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically MobileNetV2 and a simple CNN structure, consisting of the concatenation of convolutional and pooling layers called SimpleCNN, the study utilizes a three-stage approach involving data splitting, model training, and classification. The proposed methods demonstrate  a maximum F1 score of 0.8468 for the use of a pretrained MobileNetV2 in comparison to a MobileNetV2 without pretrained weights and SimpleCNN where an F1 score of 0.7516 was yielded. The research conducts the potential of CNNs without pretrained weights, for automated KOA diagnosis and severity classification, offering valuable insights for further exploration in this domain.},
