Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jean Janssen, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/partner-program-master/artificial-intelligence). Before starting on my graduate studies, I successfully completed a Bachelor of Science program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the aforementioned institution. During my bachelor's, I performed research on modelling insulin regulation via PID control and estimated personalized computational models of an individual's glucose insulin-regulation using the least squares parameter estimation technique.

Outside of my studies, I currently work as a shift leader at Albert Heijn Jan Linders. Through this role, I have gained leadership skills that I can apply in different professional domains.

My academic interests lie in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, where I currently work with omics data. Further details can be found on the projects page, where you can find the reports made during various project throughout my academic career.

In my personal time, I enjoy playing football and perform voluntary work to support the local club.
